This dataset is a comprehensive collection of information related to a fictitious e-commerce clothing retailer, designed to simulate real-world data analytics scenarios you might encounter in the industry.
It includes data on customers, products, orders, logistics, web events, and digital marketing campaigns.
Your task will be to navigate through this dataset to uncover valuable insights that could help drive business decisions.*

## Expected Outcomes
Participants leverage this dataset to:

* **Select an Area of Focus:** Choose a specific aspect of the business to analyze. This could be sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, or inventory efficiency.
* **Conduct a Detailed Analysis:** Utilize PowerBI to dive deeper into your chosen area. Apply segmentation, calculate KPIs to assess business performance, such as sales revenue, customer acquisition, and conversion rates, and use the visualization techniques you‚Äôve learned to explore the data from multiple angles.
* **Develop Recommendations:** Based on your analysis, craft actionable recommendations for the business. Consider how they can leverage your insights to improve their operations, marketing strategies, product offerings, or customer engagement.

By doing that:

* You will gain hands-on experience in applying PowerBi concepts to real-oriented data.
* Insights derived from the analysis will contribute to informed decision-making within an e-commerce business context.
* The project presentation will showcase participants‚Äô ability to analyze complex datasets and communicate findings effectively.

## Additional Considerations:
* Ensure referential integrity by enforcing foreign key constraints between related tables.
* Use appropriate data types and indexing to optimize query performance.
* Consider denormalization techniques for improving query performance in analytical workloads.
* Regularly update and maintain the dataset to reflect changes in e-commerce operations over time.

# Setting Goals and Project Organisation - 30min / 1H <br/>
## Defining Analytical Objectives
IMPORTANT! To begin, choose only two or three points, from the business cases. If you have more time throughout the day, you can continue covering other topics.
Once you have chosen the topics to discuss, identify the main tables that you will use. Those will be the tables you will continue working with. There are different topics and tables to cover, the purpose of the challenge is not to cover them all in one day, but to be able to select which ones are the most relevant to get the job done.

* Define specific analytical objectives based on the business questions identified earlier.
* Use the differents tools from PowerBi to achieve these objectives.
**Some business cases you could explore for the Project related to the key bussiness question:**

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 3H / 4H <br/>
## Checking Data Quality< br / >
Checking data quality is crucial because the reliability and accuracy of the data directly impact the outcomes of analyses, decision-making, and business operations. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to flawed insights, misguided strategies, and unreliable results, emphasizing the importance of ensuring data quality for trustworthy and impactful outcomes.

Take some minutes to answer this questions

* Are all the columns types good?
* Nomenclature is clear?
* There is some missing data?
* There outliers?
## Data Cleaning <br/>
Cleaning the data is essential to eliminate inconsistencies, errors, and inaccuracies, ensuring that analyses and models are based on reliable information and leading to more accurate and trustworthy insights.
Here is a list of tasks to keep in mind when cleaning the data:

Navigate to the Power Query Editor.
Identify and handle missing values, ensuring to either fill or remove them based on the context.
Correct any inconsistent data entries, such as formatting errors in product names or categories.
Convert data types where necessary, e.g., transforming text dates to datetime format.
Remove duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
## Exploratory Data Analysis <br/>

# Getting All Together - 1H <br/>
Create your own report. You will have 10 minutes at the end of the day to present your findings.

A good presentation should include:

* A clear problem statement at the beginning (don‚Äôt hesitate to put yourself in a role to explain your objectives and the decisions you‚Äôve made - without going into technical details).
* Relevant data, charts and analysis to address the problem
* A list of recommended actions to take moving forward
**IMPORTANT ! Remember** It‚Äôs not about how many charts or how much data you show!
Your role as a Data Analyst is to interpret that data and present your findings for better decision-making.

**Time to Present the Result!**
Good luck with your presentations!
